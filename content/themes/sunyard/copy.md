	_old_ Many knew it as the Truck Farm. Back in the day, produce was sold here. Much music was made here. It’s steamy and lush. Grapefruits and meyer lemons fall to the ground from laden trees. The next chapter for this magical place is The Sun Yard, home to a small hotel and gathering space for visitors, neighbors, and New Orleanians. The Sun Yard will consist of brightly hued and meticulously restored creole cottages, and a handful of outbuildings with some outdoor cat claw bath tubs to boot.

## About Page

	Who are the creators and developers behind the Sun Yard?!

	We are a husband and wife, Giuliano Pignataro and Liz Solms, and we run Spruce Street Commons, a real estate company rooted in historic preservation and environmentalism. We love New Orleans. Liz went to Tulane in the late nineties, and both of us have been coming to visit NOLA for both short and long periods since we were small children. We’ve been coming to the Bywater for a long time now, and have certainly seen the neighborhood drastically shift and change. We are excited to create a new place to stay for visitors on St. Claude Avenue, and to open up the former Truck Farm to our neighbors for a swim, a bite to eat, a place to chill. We were both born and raised in downtown Philly and have lived in Jamaica, West Indies for over a decade. Liz is a designer and artist whose background is in tropical agriculture. Her main work is with small hotels. Spruce Street Commons focuses as much on historic preservation as on bringing community together through the arts, and supporting local creatives. As a business, Spruce Street Commons is committed to classic design, environmental sustainability, and meticulous preservation of historic structures.

	As a local, what will this new hotel and restaurant space offer me (and/or my family)?

	Our intention is to offer as many attractive events and happenings to the community as to the hotel guests. The idea is that our hotel guests get to experience life on St. Claude Avenue, and your own out of town guests can stay close by without staying at an AirBnb. When designing the space, we have created and maintained covered areas where events/workshops/gatherings can be held. We hope our restaurant is another delicious place on your list to get a bite to eat. We are also aware of the lack of family-friendly pools in the area for those HOT summer months and beyond…so come swim. It will be kept affordable. And please, give us feedback on what you’d like to see at the Sun Yard the most.

	As a visitor how will staying at the Sun Yard be different than other places to stay in New Orleans?

	A recent article in Conde Nast Traveler lamented that there’s yet to be a design-forward, comfortable, AND interesting place to stay in New Orleans. We think the Sun Yard will be just that. You’ll be able to stay in the heart of the St. Claude Arts district and walk to the French Quarter. You’ll be able to stay in one of the most environmentally sustainable hotels in Louisiana amidst fruit trees and a swimming pool. You’ll be able to patronize local businesses and see local art in one of the most creative neighborhoods in world.

	What about noise?

	We understand that noise is a huge issue of concern. We are extremely aware of our proximity to our neighbors and our nightly guests desire to sleep well. Noise pollution is an issue we are focused on. For starters, we plan to keep good neighborly hours. We have already retained and received analysis from an acoustician that has experience working in the neighborhood. His recommendations have informed elements of the schematic design and programmatic planning. An example of this is the positioning of the new buildings we are proposing to add to the site. We will also be specifying the yard’s perimeter walls to be as sound dampening as possible, contentiously engineering sound equipment, and using landscaping and water features strategically to mitigate any nuisance.

	How will the hotel interact positively with the neighborhood?

	Our hope is to be the biggest champions of the St. Claude Arts District and all of the local businesses up and down the corridor so our guests know what’s cool and what’s happening on any given day and night. Let us know what’s up. We are also hoping to have an artist in residence program where a working New Orleans artist lives on site and offers programming to guests and locals alike. Lastly, we will be an employer of approximately 30 folks at the Sun Yard. We offer fair pay and benefits in an equitable work environment. Our priority is hiring folks from the neighborhood and surrounding neighborhoods. and to hire returning citizens, those New Orleanians who have previously been incarcerated. This is an issue that is particularly important to us.
